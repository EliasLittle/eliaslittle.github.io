# CDS Does Frontend

### Quick ways to put stuff on the internet
- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)
    - File -> Publish to the Web
- [Notion](https://notion.so)
    - App for creating notes, storing information
    - Highly extensible, easy to use
    - Share -> Share to web
- Shortlinks
    - Shorten long urls to make them more shareable 
    - I recommend [cuttly](https://cutt.ly)
        - Can attach your own domain for free for completely custom links
    - Also [Bitly](https://bitly.com) and [TinyUrl](https://tiny.cc)
- Domains
    - Names that redirect to a server where your website is hosted
    - Cost money, but prices go from $1/year to hundreds of thousands (for like google.com)
    - Can buy from lots of places
        - [tld-list](https://tld-list.com) compares prices and extensions
        - [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com), [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com), [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) are all popular

### Simple Websites
- Markup languages
    - Used to describe how to display text and other content
    - HTML = HyperText Markup Language
    - [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is a simpler language
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
    - Github will automatically publish your Markdown and HTML files
    - Create a repository titled `yourGithubUsername.github.io`
    - Add a `index.md` or `index.html` file and you're off to the races!
    - You can also add a `_config.yml` to specify a few things like the title and description
    - Can add HTML layouts that can be reused on multiple pages
    - THIS is a github pages website, source code can be found [here](https://github.com/EliasLittle/eliaslittle.github.io)

### Advanced Websites
- Usually use a Javascript Framework
    - These can get complicated fast, but are really powerful
    - Popular ones include:
        - [React](https://reactjs.org)
        - [Vue](https://vue-community.org)
        - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
        - [Angular](https://angularjs.org)
    - I mostly use Vue with [Nuxt](http://nuxtjs.org) a framework on top of Vue
    - I have also briefly messed around with Svelte. 
- Deployed using some hosting service
    - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a popular one, which I personally use
    - [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
    - AWS, Google, Azure, etc...
- A popular and easy philosophy for building website is something called [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org)
    - Stands for Javascript, Apis & Markdown
    - Idea is to use static websites built with markdown and use javascript to make api calls for data
